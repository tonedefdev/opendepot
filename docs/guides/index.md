    ---

    Day-2 admin runbooks for force re-sync, module/provider lifecycle operations, scanning checks, and pre-signed URL tuning.

    Restrict which modules and providers each OIDC group may access using `GroupBinding` resources and expr-lang expressions.

    ---

    Enable the browsable registry frontend, configure public visibility labels, and set up OIDC login and `GroupBinding`-based access for the UI.
